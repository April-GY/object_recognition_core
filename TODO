Build:
- no default build of tutorials
- no default build of tests
- split the tests (db tests should at least be separated)

Interface:
- --all should also have a --missing
- remove --db options
- meshing should support --all, --mising, --object_ids
- have a common file for common options (author, db) : split parameters with that file too, even for training/detection/meshing/upload
- autogeneration of parameter files:autogenerate if it does not exist

Performance:
- SBA
- RANSAC
- Mike's stuff

DB:
- make a base calss ModelLoader
- delete things from the DB, find orphans, find missing components (models ...), find duplicates
- better object representation (model, inline images, 3d models ...)
- be able to only replicate models in a DB (to put on the PR2)
- add meta data that is missing (meet with everybody). We want: timestamp of the session, the sensor id

Capture:
- SBA should be a blackbox for pose adjustment: maybe in capture, or in TOD training
- GUI for capturing obejcts on a dot pattern: the current box is hacky
- upload through the capture GUI. Also have the triggering of all the other models (RabbitMQ ...)
- should be a parameter file for the type of fiducials
- unify the different Kinect calls to use the Kinect source (grep for /camera/depth)

Doc:
- API docs

New cells:
- masks, filters
- Mike's stuff
- better interface of several pipeline (actually broken now)

Test:
- have something for performance. Use NIST.
