Detection
========

Using the different trained objects, we can now detect them

Short How-to
------------

Just run the detection.py script in /apps. The "--help" option details the different options/arguments of the script. Those have two types for now:
 - which source to read from (kinect, ROS bag ...)
 - which sink to send the data to (terminal, csv file, ...)

Sources
-------

Right now

Sinks
-----

The object_recognition pipeline currently supports the following outputs:
 - terminal TODO
 - 

Core
----

Once the inputs and outputs of the object_recognition pipeline are chosen, one or more several pipelines can be chosen to process the data
